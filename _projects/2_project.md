It is a time series analysis project using LSTM neural network. In this project, the traffic flow is predicted as a regression problem to control the traffic flow. The traffic flow prediction is done across 4 junctions. The project was done using python, and numerous libraries. The major libraries used libraries are numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, seaborn, and matplotlib.
