<b>Thesis: </b>Federated Ensemble-Learning for Transport Mode Detection in Vehicular Edge Network<br>

> The thesis presents a Transport Mode Detection (TMD) system that predicts people's mode of transportation using Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things technology. The Federated Learning hybrid model, which uses a majority voting ensembling method, has an accuracy rate of 94-95% for one dataset and 98-99% for another dataset. The system attempts to explore data privacy and latency issues through Distributed Federated Learning on Vehicular Edge Networks (VEN).
