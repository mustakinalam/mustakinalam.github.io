I am a passionate lecturer, researcher, and machine learning engineer with expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Federated Learning, and Natural Language Processing. I have extensive experience working on diverse projects that involve developing cutting-edge approaches to solve complex problems in these areas. I worked as a machine learning engineer, where I apply my expertise to develop and deploy machine learning models for practical applications. I also served as an adjunct lecturer at BRAC University. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD in Computer Science and serving as a graduate teaching assistant at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

Throughout my time in the field of Machine Learning, I have successfully contributed to the development of custom models and algorithms, significantly improving the performance of existing systems. I am constantly exploring new applications of these technologies to tackle real-world problems and drive innovation. My research interests encompass not only advancing the field of machine learning but also leveraging interdisciplinary knowledge to address broader challenges.

In addition to my practical experience, I have actively contributed to the research community by submitting and publishing several papers in prestigious conferences and journals related to machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am driven by the desire to collaborate with like-minded individuals who share a passion for research, innovation, and pushing the boundaries of what is possible in these exciting fields.
