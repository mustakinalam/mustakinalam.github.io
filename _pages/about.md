I am a passionate researcher with expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Federated Learning, and Natural Language Processing. I have worked on several projects that involve developing approaches to solve complex problems in these areas. My research interests include developing custom models and algorithms that can improve the performance of existing systems. I am also interested in exploring new applications of these technologies to solve real-world problems. I have submitted and published several papers in conferences and journals in these areas. I am looking for opportunities to work with like-minded individuals who are passionate about research and innovation.
